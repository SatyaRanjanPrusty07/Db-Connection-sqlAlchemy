# Db-Connection-sqlAlchemy
Db Opertaions using sqlAlchemy

In this project I Showed how to perform basic db operations like create, retrive, update, delete through sqlalchemy. For sqlalchemy project we need to execute pip install sqlalchemy in python powershell. After that we need to import declarative_base,sessionmaker from sqlalchemy.orm we can import declarative_base from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative also. I used Sqlite for this project
